# Nucleo Simulink Package
**Develop by: Charles Dias**

## Description
Project for support STM32 Nucleo boards using Matlab Coder and Simulink Coder. The Embedded Coder license is not necessary.

The aim is to generate automatic code using the Simulink and STM32CubeMx, providing blocks for using the drivers in STM32HAL.

#### Attention
The STMicroelectronics provides an amazing package for automatically generated code called [STM32-MAT/TARGET](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32-mat-target.html). However, for using this package you have to install the Embedded Coder that unfortunately is not available for a student license.
